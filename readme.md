# Learning Docker

##### The repository contains important concepts, commands, notes and source code about docker. We are going to go into more details from and learn about best practices, strategies, building docker images, docker container security, development workflows and deployment strategies.

##### We are going to have an fullstack application that we will be using to learn about docker. The application is a simple application that has a frontend and a backend to showcase how to handle different languages in docker. The frontend is build on:

    - React

##### while the backend is build on

    -  Nodejs
    -  Golang (to show how different languages can be used in docker)

##### Later will be deploy to:

    - Docker Swarm (Container orchestration build into docker)
    - railway.app
    - kubernetes

Unlike virtual machines, containers do not have the high overhead and hence enable more efficient usage of the underlying system and resources.
